</p>
This happens when the AI ​​is able to notice a pre-calculated insight, whose value of operations tends to be optimistic, that is, the growth of shares, we recommend buying assets when obtaining this insight.

<br/>

* **Scores** - **Pessimistic Indicators** for Traders

<p>
<img src="./assets/6.png" alt="5" width="150">
</p>

This happens when the AI ​​is able to notice a pre-calculated insight, whose value of operations tends to be pessimistic, that is, when the shares decline, we recommend selling assets when it obtains this insight.

<br/>

* **Scores** - **Unrealistic Indicators** for Traders

<p>
<img src="./assets/7.png" alt="5" width="150">
</p>

This happens when the AI ​​is able to notice a pre-calculated insight, whose value of operations tends not to be as expected, that is, different growths or declines of the shares, we recommend not selling or buying assets when it obtains this insight. (Although this is a rare insight, the ideal is not to invest for the next 90 seconds and analyze another image after this period).

<br/>

* **Scores** - **No indicators** for Traders

<p>
<img src="./assets/8.png" alt="5" width="150">
</p>

This happens when the AI ​​**cannot** notice a pre-calculated insight, whose value of operations tends to be unrealistic, that is, it returns the image as it was sent. We recommend modifying the "accuracy" percentage next to it (number from 0 to 100) to a lower number than the one entered. (Although this is a common insight, the ideal is to modify the percentage and, in case of reluctance, wait for the next 90 seconds and analyze another image after this period).
